AlltoAvi Perl (ARCHIVE)
This project is a tool to convert especially ogm and mkv files to avi, with subtitle and audio track selection, video resizing, bitrate selection and codec selection. It is centered around mencoder.

This is a historical project, mostly dead. If someone posts a patch or bug report I may fix it but this has been a dead project since 2007

History
In 2006 I was big in to fansub anime and bought a DIVX dvd player for my TV. I wanted a product that could batch encode my piles of anime on my linux box, virtualdubmod and closed were not cutting it.
I found a C++ program called AllToAvi http://alltoavi.sourceforge.net but it's Linux version had fallen completely behind because the author was busy and no longer used linux. I decided to rewrite the entire thing in Perl.
Once I had finished making a fully working perl version I started working on adding more and more features and making it more robust. At one point I even managed to end up forking my own project.

I have NOT worked on this since 2007. It's good code and likely still works but I can't even tell you which version runs best at this point. The 4.9.5 is preset based while 4.8.5 asks you for everything.

I also included the old AlltoAvi C++ files that I based this from. They are not written by me.
